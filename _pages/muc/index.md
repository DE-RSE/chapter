Our group is the place to meet other [research software engineers](https://de-rse.org/en/) in Munich. We aim for a meeting every two months, followed by dinner and networking.

Our meetings include short talks about anything related to RSE (research data management, software development, teaching/training, and more), as well as open discussions on topics brought into the agenda by any attendee.

## Contact

We organize ourselves mainly over the [Mailing list](https://lists.lrz.de/mailman/listinfo/rse) and a [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#derse-chapter-muc:gitter.im). Definitely join us there to learn about upcoming events and other activities.

For questions regarding the group, feel free to contact, for example:
  - [Larissa Leiminger](https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/about-us/team.html) - MPDL
  - [Martin Spenger](https://www.ub.uni-muenchen.de/ueber-die-ub/kontakt/personen/spenger/index.html) - LMU
  - [Gerasimos Chourdakis](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sccs/people/gerasimos-chourdakis/) - Univ. Stuttgart / TUM

**Sprache:** Um die Reichweite der Gruppe zu maximieren und mit Rücksicht auf die vielen nicht-deutschen Studenten, Doktoranden und Forscher in München, ist die Arbeitssprache der Gruppe Englisch. Natürlich bleibt Deutsch immer eine Option für die Diskussionen.
