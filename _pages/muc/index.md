Our group is the place to meet other [research software engineers](https://de-rse.org/en/) in Munich. We aim for a meeting every two months, followed by dinner and networking.

Our meetings include short talks about anything related to RSE (research data management, software development, teaching/training, and more), as well as open discussions on topics brought into the agenda by any attendee.
