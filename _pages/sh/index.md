**Welcome!**

We are Research Software Engineers from Schleswig-Holstein. You are warmly invited to get in touch with us — we appreciate questions, discussions, and of course active participation.

## Meetings

Our meetings are currently organized mainly by members of the **Working Group on Research Software Engineering** within the state initiative [**FDM.SH**](#fdmsh). However, everyone interested in research software, research data, or community building is very welcome to join.

*The meetings will take place online. We aim to convene on a quarterly basis, and additional meetings can be arranged upon request. If you would like to join, please [contact us](#get-in-touch) for access details or subscribe to our [mailing list](https://www.listserv.dfn.de/sympa/info/fdm-sh-rse).*

## FDM.SH

**FDM.SH** is the state initiative for research data management in Schleswig-Holstein. It promotes collaborative solutions, supports coordination across institutions, and helps build shared structures for managing research data. Through joint efforts, expertise is pooled and made accessible to strengthen modern, FAIR-aligned research data practices throughout the state.

Within FDM.SH, a dedicated [**Working Group on Research Software Engineering**](https://fdm-sh.de/en/working_groups/#wg-rse) has formed — and it is from this group that the application for a Schleswig-Holstein chapter of **de-RSE** was submitted in December 2025.

The working group aims to:

- foster sustainable, transparent, and FAIR-oriented practices for research software and related data,
- connect existing expertise across institutions in Schleswig-Holstein,
- create exchange formats that facilitate networking between RDM experts, RSEs, and researchers.

More information is available on the **[FDM.SH website](https://fdm-sh.de)**.
